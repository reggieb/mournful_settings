# History
# =======
#
# 0.1.1: Improves query to find setting via for
# ---------------------------------------------
# It makes sense for settings to be identified via a symbol, as this is a label.
# However, best practice for querying a database is to pass in a string to
# represent the data being retrieved. So the _for_ method has been altered to
# convert the setting's name into a string before passing it to ActiveRecord
# within a query. See: https://github.com/ernie/squeel/issues/67
# 
# 0.1.0: Acts As Mournful Setting
# -------------------------------
# Changes the way Mournful settings are used. Settings can now be defined via
# an acts_as_mournful_setting declaration rather than inheriting from 
# MournfulSettings::Setting. Inheritance is still supported 
# 
# 
# 0.0.6: Adds default option
# --------------------------
# Allows alternative to be set, that will be used until setting defined
# 
# 
# 0.0.5: Corrects gem description
# -------------------------------
# No functional change.
# 
# 
# 0.0.4: Changing cipher configuration
# ------------------------------------
# Adds facility to allow cipher to be changed with existing live data
# 
# 
# 0.0.3: Encrypted by default
# ---------------------------
# Modifies model and active admin registration file to make encrypting settings
# the default behaviour.
# 
# 
# 0.0.2: Add active admin option
# ------------------------------
# Adds active admin integration options.
# 
# 
# 0.0.1: First release
